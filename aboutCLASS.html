            Agriculture in the 21st century is faced with the herculean task of providing for the needs of a growing world population particularly in the event of a changing climate.
             To make informed decisions and preparing the future workforce for mitigating risks related to climate change in agriculture, 
             climate change education (CCE) emerges as a crucial area for K-12 educators, students, college students, as well as agricultural communities.

            The CLASS (Climate Literacy for Agriculture and Sustainable Societies) program is part of The UT Martin-Murray State Climate Change Education Initiative and is funded by the Capacity Building Grants for Non-Land Grant Colleges of Agriculture Program (NLGCA), United States Department of Agriculture, National Institute of Food and Agriculture (PROJ NO: TENW-2016-06721).

            The primary focus of this initiative is to address the gap in perception and understanding regarding climate change among stakeholders in rural communities, and to enhance the educational curriculum in high schools and higher education institutes with a focus on climate change. The scope of work for this project consists of creating web-based courses, and educational materials with a focus on climates and climate change impacts on agricultural economies, providing research and educational learning opportunities to enrolled students in the climate change area, and conducting educational workshops for stakeholders with a focus on climate change in northwest Tennessee and western Kentucky.
